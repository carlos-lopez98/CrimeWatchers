                                but in
                                the majority of cases tends to protect the animal from danger by rendering it less
                                conspicuous.
                                Perhaps it may be said that if coloring is mainly protective, there ought to be but few
                                brightly
                                colored animals. There are, however, not a few cases in which vivid colors are
                                themselves
                                protective. The kingfisher itself, though so brightly colored, is by no means easy to
                                see.
                                The
                                blue harmonizes with the water, and the bird as it darts along the stream looks almost
                                like
                                a
                                flash of sunlight.</p>
