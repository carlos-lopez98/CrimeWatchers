        <h1>How to Perform CPR </h1>
        <p><u><b>Step 1. Call 911</b></u>
            <br>
            <br>
            <u><b>Step 2. Place the person on their back and open their airway</b></u>
            <br>
            <br>
            <u><b>Step 3. Check for breathing</b></u>
            <br>
            <br>
            <u><b>Step 4. Perform 30 chest compressions</b></u>
            <br>
            <br>
            Place one of your hands on top of the other and clasp them together. With the heel of the hands and straight elbows, push hard and fast in the center of the chest, slightly below the nipples.
            <br>
            Push at least 2 inches deep. Compress their chest at a rate of least 100 times per minute. Let the chest rise fully between compressions.
            <br>

            <br>
            <br>
            <u><b>Step 5. Perform two rescue breaths</b></u>
            <br>
            <br>
            Making sure their mouth is clear, tilt their head back slightly and lift their chin. Pinch their nose shut, place your mouth fully over theirs, and blow to make their chest rise.
            <br>
            If their chest does not rise with the first breath, retilt their head. If their chest still does not rise with a second breath, the person might be choking.

            <br>
            <u><b>Step 6. Repeat</b></u>
            <br>
            <br>
            Repeat the cycle of 30 chest compressions and two rescue breaths until the person starts breathing or help arrives. If an AED arrives, carry on performing CPR until the machine is set up and ready to use.
